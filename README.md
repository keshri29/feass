This project is a frontend assignment for AccuKnox, designed to create an interactive CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) Dashboard. The dashboard features widgets for cloud account risk assessment, namespace-specific alerts, workload alerts, and more. The project is built using React, Context API for state management, and Chart.js for visualizations.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keshri29/accuknox-Assignment-For-Frontend-Trainees.git
   cd accuknox-Assignment-For-Frontend-Trainees
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the required packages by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   Run the following command to start the application in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

After starting the development server, you can access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`. 

- **Adding Widgets:** Use the "Add Widget +" button in the Navbar to dynamically add widgets to the dashboard.
- **Removing Widgets:** Each widget has a "Remove" button that allows you to delete the widget from the dashboard.

## State Management

State management is handled globally using Context API. This allows the dynamic addition and removal of widgets across the application without prop drilling.

## Widget Management

Widgets in the dashboard can be added or removed dynamically. The structure of the widgets is defined in the `Dashboard.js` file, and the content (such as charts) is managed within individual components like `CircularChart.js`.
